            <div class="text">We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.
                To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition you received it, unworn or unused, 
                with tags attached and in the original packaging. You will also need your receipt or proof of purchase.
                To initiate a refund, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:parallaxclub@gmail.com">PARALLAXCLUB@GMAIL.COM</a>.
                If your return is accepted,
                we will send you a return shipping label as well as instructions on how and where to ship 
                your package. Items sent to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
                You can always contact us with any questions about returns at <a href="mailto:parallaxclub@gmail.com">parallaxclub@GMAI.COM</a>.

                or if you received the wrong item so we can assess the problem and fix it.

            <div class="text">The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have and, 
                after accepting the return, make a separate purchase for the new item.</div>
